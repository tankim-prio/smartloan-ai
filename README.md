## Project Overview

**SmartLoan AI** is a realistic loan application processing platform designed to demonstrate practical software engineering, applied AI/ML integration, document intelligence, and end-to-end workflow automation.

The system allows an applicant to create a loan application, generate a loan PDF, upload documents, extract information from PDFs, run machine learning based loan risk prediction, send the application for review, and allow an admin or reviewer to approve or refuse the application.

This project connects multiple real-world software components into one complete workflow:

* Frontend application
* Backend REST API
* Database-backed loan workflow
* PDF generation
* PDF text extraction
* OCR-based document processing
* Machine learning prediction
* Admin review system
* Dashboard and reports
* AI/RAG-style document assistant
* Dockerized deployment

---

## Project Objective

The main objective of SmartLoan AI is to simulate a real-world digital loan processing platform where user data, financial documents, machine learning prediction, document extraction, and human review are connected in one professional system.

This project is suitable for:

* International job recruiter review
* University project evaluation
* AI Engineer portfolio
* Machine Learning Engineer portfolio
* Backend Developer portfolio
* Full-stack Developer portfolio
* Document intelligence project showcase
* Dockerized application demonstration
* Real-world workflow automation demonstration

## Local Development Setup

### Backend

```powershell
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 20000
```

Backend URL:

```text
http://localhost:20000
```

### Frontend

```powershell
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev -- --host localhost --port 5173
```

Frontend URL:

```text
http://localhost:5173
```

---

## Docker Setup

Run the full project from the root directory:

```powershell
docker compose up --build
```

Frontend:

```text
http://localhost:5173
```

Backend:

```text
http://localhost:20000
```

Stop Docker:

```powershell
docker compose down
```

---

## Health Check URLs

```text
http://localhost:20000/api/v1/customer-portal/health
http://localhost:20000/api/v1/ml/health
http://localhost:20000/api/v1/ai-rag/health
```

---

## API Areas

The backend is organized into modular API areas:

* Authentication API
* Customer Portal API
* Loan Application API
* PDF Generation API
* PDF Extraction API
* Review Workflow API
* ML Prediction API
* AI/RAG Assistant API
* Dashboard and Reports API

---

## Docker Persistence Design

The Docker version is designed to preserve important local data by using volume mapping.

Persistent areas include:

* SQLite database files
* Uploaded PDFs
* Generated PDFs
* Document uploads
* Storage folders
* Application records
* Review records

This helps the Docker workflow behave closer to the local development workflow instead of starting from an empty container every time.
