## Project Overview
SmartLoan AI is a realistic loan application processing platform designed to demonstrate practical software engineering, applied AI/ML integration, document intelligence, and end-to-end workflow automation.

The system allows an applicant to create a loan application, generate a loan PDF, upload documents, extract information from PDFs, run machine learning based loan risk prediction, send the application for review, and allow an admin or reviewer to approve or refuse the application.

This project connects multiple real-world software components into one complete workflow:
* Frontend application
* Backend REST API
* Database-backed loan workflow
* PDF generation
* PDF text extraction
* OCR-based document processing
* Machine learning prediction
* Admin review system
* Dashboard and reports
* AI/RAG-style document assistant
* Dockerized deployment

---

*All JSON columns store flexible schemas validated by Pydantic on the backend, ensuring type safety and extensibility.*

---

## Security Architecture

SmartLoan AI implements several security layers to protect data and ensure safe operations:

- **Password Hashing**: All passwords are hashed using `bcrypt` before storage.
- **Input Validation**: Pydantic schemas enforce strict data validation on every API request.
- **File Upload Safety**: Uploaded files are validated for type (PDF, PNG, JPG) and size limits; stored outside the web root.
- **CORS Configuration**: Restrictive CORS policies allow only the frontend origin.
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: SQLAlchemy ORM with parameterized queries eliminates injection risks.
- **Error Handling**: Generic error messages in production prevent information leakage.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Admin endpoints are protected by role checks; applicants cannot access review functions.
- **Environment Variables**: Secrets (SECRET_KEY, database URL) are never hardcoded, always injected via environment.

*Future roadmap includes adding JWT tokens, refresh token rotation, and rate limiting.*

---

## Caching & Performance Optimizations

- **ML Model Caching**: The risk prediction model is loaded once at application startup and reused across requests.
- **PDF Generation**: Heavy PDF operations run synchronously but are optimized with ReportLab's buffering.
- **Static Files**: Nginx serves React build files directly, bypassing the backend.
- **Database Indexing**: Frequently queried columns (user_id, status) are indexed.
- **OCR Batching**: When multiple pages need OCR, they are processed sequentially with memory-efficient Pillow operations.

*No external cache (Redis) is required for the current scope, keeping the system simple yet performant.*

---

## Logging & Monitoring

- **Backend Logging**: Python's `logging` module records all API requests, errors, and service calls (PDF generation, ML prediction, extraction) to stdout.
- **Structured Logs**: Logs include timestamps, request IDs (planned), and status codes for easy analysis.
- **Docker Logs**: All container output is accessible via `docker-compose logs`.
- **Health Checks**: Dedicated endpoints (`/health`) allow monitoring tools to verify service availability.
- **Error Tracking**: Unhandled exceptions are caught by FastAPI middleware and logged with full stack traces.

*For production, integration with ELK stack or Grafana Loki is recommended.*

---

## Deployment Topology

The system is deployed as a multi-container Docker application:

```
[ Browser ] → [ Nginx (port 80) ] → [ React Frontend (static files) ]
                                 ↘ [ FastAPI Backend (port 8000) ]
                                       ├── SQLite (volume mounted)
                                       ├── Uploads (volume mounted)
                                       └── Generated PDFs (volume mounted)
```

- **Nginx** acts as reverse proxy and static file server.
- **Frontend container** serves the built React app via Nginx in production, or dev server in development.
- **Backend container** runs Uvicorn with `--workers 1` (sufficient for SQLite single-writer constraint).
- **Volumes** persist database and files, enabling seamless restarts and data retention.

---

## Data Flow & Component Interaction

1. **User Action**: Clicks “Submit Application” on React UI.
2. **API Call**: POST `/api/applications/{id}/submit` with application ID.
3. **Backend Orchestration**:
   - Updates application status to `submitted`.
   - Calls `DocumentService.extract()` for each uploaded document → stores extracted text and structured JSON.
   - Calls `MLPredictor.predict()` with applicant financial data → stores risk score, band, explanation.
   - Calls `PDFGenerator.create_loan_summary()` → stores path to generated PDF.
4. **Admin Review**: Admin loads review board → backend returns all `submitted` applications with full details.
5. **Decision**: Admin PUTs review action → application status updated, review log created.
6. **User Notification**: Frontend polls or refreshes dashboard to see new status.

*All interactions are synchronous REST calls; no message queue is used to keep the architecture simple and showcaseable.*

---

## Main Application Workflow

1. **Applicant Registration / Login** – Secure JWT token-based authentication (planned; currently session/cookie auth for demo).
2. **Loan Application Form** – Multi-step data entry covering personal, employment, financial, and loan details. Each step auto-saves a draft.
3. **Document Upload** – Applicants attach income proofs, ID documents (NID, passport), salary certificates (PDF or image). Backend queues extraction.
4. **Automated Processing** – On submission, the system:
   - Extracts text from uploaded documents (with OCR fallback).
   - Launches ML risk prediction.
   - Generates a complete loan‑summary PDF.
5. **Admin Review** – Application moves to *Pending Review*. Admin can inspect extracted data, ML insight, and original documents on a unified review screen.
6. **Decision** – Admin approves or refuses; status updates instantly in both admin and applicant dashboards.
7. **Reporting** – All actions are logged and reflected in aggregated reports.

---

## Machine Learning Workflow

- **Dataset:** Synthetic financial profiles generated to mimic real bank application data, containing income, loan amount, employment type, existing credit, and target (approved/refused).
- **Model:** A gradient boosting classifier trained on the synthetic dataset. Feature engineering includes debt-to-income ratio, income stability score, and employment tenure encoding.
- **Training Script:** Located in `backend/ml/train_model.py`. Outputs `risk_model.pkl` and a preprocessor.
- **Inference:** The model is loaded once at FastAPI startup. The `/api/predict` endpoint accepts JSON payload and returns:
  - `approval_probability` (0–1)
  - `risk_score` (absolute number)
  - `risk_band` (`Low` / `Medium` / `High`)
  - `explanation` – human‑readable reason highlighting top feature contributions (e.g., “Your loan amount is well within the safe threshold relative to your income.”).
- **Interpretability:** Top contributing features are extracted from the model's internal feature importance (or SHAP values if enabled) and converted to natural language templates.

---

## PDF Intelligence Workflow

1. **Upload Handling** – Files stored in `backend/data/uploads/`.
2. **Detection** – System checks if the PDF contains a digital text layer.
3. **Native Extraction** – If text exists, PyMuPDF (`fitz`) extracts all paragraphs with positional metadata.
4. **OCR Fallback** – If no text (scanned document), each page is rendered to a high‑res image; `pytesseract` extracts raw text.
5. **Structuring** – Regex and custom parsers locate:
   - Monthly income (e.g., “Gross Salary: 85,000 BDT”)
   - Employer name
   - Designation
   - NID/passport number patterns
   - Document issue/expiry dates
6. **Output** – Structured JSON stored alongside the application, ready for the admin review board.

---

## Important Pages

- **`/login`** – Authentication page
- **`/dashboard`** – Applicant’s personal dashboard showing all applications and statuses
- **`/apply`** – Multi‑step loan application form with draft support
- **`/application/:id`** – Detail view for a single application (generated PDF, extracted text, ML result)
- **`/admin/review`** – Admin review board (pending queue)
- **`/admin/application/:id`** – Full inspection view with approval/refusal actions
- **`/admin/reports`** – Charts and aggregated pipeline data
- **`/admin/assistant`** – AI document assistant chat interface

## Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+ & npm
- Tesseract OCR (for OCR features) – install via system package manager (`sudo apt install tesseract-ocr` on Ubuntu, `brew install tesseract` on macOS, or download installer for Windows)
- Git

### Backend
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Optionally train the ML model (if not already present)
python ml/train_model.py
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev                   # Vite dev server on http://localhost:5173
```

### Environment Variables (Backend)
A `.env` file (copy from `.env.example`) containing:
```
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./data/smartloan.db
UPLOAD_DIR=./data/uploads
GENERATED_DIR=./data/generated
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
```
These are set automatically in the Docker environment.

---

## Docker Setup

```bash
# Build and start all services (frontend, backend, nginx)
docker-compose up --build

# Run in detached mode
docker-compose up -d --build

# Stop all containers
docker-compose down
```

- **Frontend**: served on `http://localhost` (port 80) via Nginx proxy
- **Backend API**: accessible internally on port 8000, proxied by Nginx
- **Volumes**: All persistent data (database, uploads, generated files) are stored in named Docker volumes (`smartloan_db`, `smartloan_uploads`, `smartloan_generated`)

---

## Health Check URLs

- **Backend Health**: `http://localhost:8000/health`
- **Frontend**: `http://localhost/` (should return the React app)
- **ML Predictor readiness**: Backend health endpoint also verifies ML model is loaded

---

## API Areas

The backend provides RESTful endpoints grouped into these domains:

| Area               | Description                                                    |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/api/auth`        | User registration, login, profile                              |
| `/api/applications`| Create, list, update, delete loan applications; trigger PDF & prediction |
| `/api/documents`   | Upload, extract, view extracted data                           |
| `/api/predict`     | ML risk prediction endpoint                                    |
| `/api/admin`       | Admin review queue, approve/refuse actions, report data        |
| `/api/assistant`   | AI document assistant queries                                  |

---

## Docker Persistence Design

All critical application data resides in Docker volumes, not inside the containers:
- **Database**: `./backend/data/smartloan.db` → volume `smartloan_db`
- **User uploads**: `./backend/data/uploads` → volume `smartloan_uploads`
- **Generated PDFs**: `./backend/data/generated` → volume `smartloan_generated`

This ensures data survives container restarts and allows easy backup/migration.

---

## Environment Variables

| Variable           | Description                        | Default                        |
|--------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `DATABASE_URL`     | SQLAlchemy database connection     | `sqlite:///./data/smartloan.db`|
| `UPLOAD_DIR`       | Path for uploaded documents        | `./data/uploads`               |
| `GENERATED_DIR`    | Path for generated PDFs            | `./data/generated`             |
| `SECRET_KEY`       | Backend secret for session/crypto  | `changeme-in-production`       |

| Issue                                      | Solution                                                                     |
|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| OCR fails with `TesseractNotFoundError`   | Install Tesseract OCR on your host machine and ensure it is in PATH          |
| ML model not loaded (prediction fails)    | Run `python ml/train_model.py` to generate `risk_model.pkl`                 |
| Frontend can’t reach backend in Docker    | Check `nginx.conf` proxy_pass and ensure `backend` service name matches     |
| Uploaded files don’t persist after restart | Confirm Docker volumes are correctly mapped in `docker-compose.yml`         |
| Permission errors on mounted volumes       | Run `sudo chown -R 1000:1000 backend/data` on host if using Linux bind mounts|

## Project Status & Final Words

**Status:** `Completed` – fully functional, ready for demonstration, portfolio inclusion, and technical interviews.

SmartLoan AI was built to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and production‑grade implementation. It is not just a collection of independent modules, but a coherent system where each component — from the OCR engine to the admin review board — communicates seamlessly. This project reflects the kind of end‑to‑end thinking that companies seek in engineers: the ability to design, develop, containerize, and explain intelligent systems.

If you are a recruiter or a professor reviewing this work, I encourage you to run the system locally (a single `docker-compose up` is all it takes) or watch the demo video to appreciate the full user journey. For developers looking to learn or expand, the code is structured to be readable and extensible — fork it, break it, and build something even greater.

Thank you for taking the time to explore SmartLoan AI.
